#Magic 8 Ball

#In Python, modules are .py files containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python program. The Python standard library contains well over 200 modules that we can use.
#We can use the .randint() function from a module called random to generate a random number from a range.
#But first, let's import this module so we can use its functions.
#  import random

#Next, we'll create a variable to store the randomly generated value. Declare a variable called num, and assign it to the function call:
#num = random.randint(1, 9)
#This will generate a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive of both).
#Together, the code will look like:
import random

num = random.randint(1, 9)

print(num)


#The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940s for fortune-telling and advice seeking. ðŸŽ±
#It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:
#Yes - definitely.
#It is decidedly so.
#Without a doubt.
#Reply hazy, try again.
#Ask again later.
#Better not tell you now.
#My sources say no.
#Outlook not so good.
#Very doubtful.
#Create a magic8.py program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.
#The output should have the following format:
# Question:      [Question]
# Magic 8 Ball:  [Answer]

#For example:
# Question:      Is CodÃ©dex better than Udemy yet?
# Magic 8 Ball:  Better not tell you now.

# Write code below ðŸ’–
import random

question = input('Question:      ')

random_number = random.randint(1, 9)

# The if/elif/else statement starts here
