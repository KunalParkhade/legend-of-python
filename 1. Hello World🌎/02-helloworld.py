#Print
#In Python, the print() function is used to tell a computer to "talk." This is something we are going to use a lot.

#Create a new hello_world.py program.
#On a new line, use print() to output the message "Hello World!"
#And then run the program.
#Were you able to print "Hello World!" in the terminal?

# Write code below ðŸ’–
print('Hello World!')
