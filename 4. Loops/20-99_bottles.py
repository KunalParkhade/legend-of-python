#Squares

#On May 6th, 1949, EDSAC, an early electronic stored-program computer, ran its first program at the University of Cambridge.
#It calculated and printed out a list of squares:
#0   0
#1   1
#2   4
#3   9
#4   16
#5   25
#6   36
#7   49
#8   64
#9   81

#On the left, you got all the single-digit numbers from 0 to 9. On the right are their squares. For example, in the last row, 9 Ã— 9 = 81.
#This can be done in Python using string concatenation:
# String concatenation

#for i in range(5):
#  print('The square of ' + str(i) + ' is ' + str(i*i))

#The output would look like:
#The square of 0 is 0
#The square of 1 is 1
#The square of 2 is 4
#The square of 3 is 9
#The square of 4 is 16

#String Interpolation
#String interpolation is a process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string.

#For instance, if you have a template for saying hello to a person in an email like 'Hi {name}, nice to meet you!', you would like to replace the placeholder {name} with an actual name. This is string interpolation.

#"99 Bottles of Beer" is an old song that annoying kids, oops I mean everyone, sang on road trips to pass the time.
#Create a 99_bottles.py program and use a for loop and a range() function to print out all the verses of "99 Bottles of Beer."
#And don't forget to use string interpolation!

# Write code below ðŸ’–
for bottles in range(99,0,-1):
  if bottles==1:
    print(f"{bottles} of beer on the wall, {bottles} bottle of beer")
    print("Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall")
  else:
    print(f"{bottles} of beer on the wall, {bottles} bottle of beer")
    print(f"Take one down, pass it around, {bottles-1} bottles of beer on the wall")
