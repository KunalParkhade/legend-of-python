#Create an initials.py program that displays your initials in block letters.
#First, start the program with a comment that says a fun fact about yourself.
#Then, create your block letters with your initials.
#For example, if your name is Kunal Parkhade, your initials would be K and P, and your block letters would look like this:
# Write code below ðŸ’–
print("K   K PPPP")
print("K  K  P   P")
print("K K   P   P")
print("KK    PPPP ")
print("K K   P    ")
print("K  K  P    ")
print("K   K P    ")
