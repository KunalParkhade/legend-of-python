#Now you might be wondering, is there a way to iterate over a list? üîÅ
#Yep, there are multiple ways to iterate over a list in Python!

#1.for-in

#The first way is using a for-in loop. Here's an example:
snowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]

for i in snowfall:
  print(i)

#The i is a variable which represents an item inside the list, each time the loop iterates. This is saying for every item in the snowfall list, print out the item.

#2. for-in with range() and len()
#We can also loop through a list using the index (position). To do so, we need the range() function and the len() function.
#As a reminder:
#range() function returns a sequence of numbers, from 0 to a number.
  #len() function returns the length of the list.

  nowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]

for i in range(len(snowfall)):
  print(snowfall[i])

#Back in the good ol' days, a mixtape is a compilation of music, a playlist, recorded onto a cassette tape or a CD.
#Create a mixtape.py program and think of a theme for the songs.
#Make a list called playlist and throw in some songs.
#For example:

# üíø Theme: Indie Travel Songs

playlist = [
  'Porches - rangerover',
  'Mount Eerie - You Swan, Go On',
  'Carolyn Polachek - Look at Me Now',
  'Pinegrove - Darkness',
  'LVP UP - Spirit Was',
  'Mitski - First Love / Late Spring'
]

#Now loop over the list and print everything out! üìª
